        <div class="tl-item" role="button" tabindex="0" data-content="26 March, 2:00 AM — When I Felt Something
A late-night Google Meet I thought was a prank again.But it wasn’t.
We talked just a little, yet your vibe stayed with me.
Something about you felt easy… familiar… warm.
That night, without realising it,I started liking you.
19 April — Almost Us
No proper conversations yet.Just a story reply — “😭😭😭”.Then came the reels.(samaj pe) wasn’t official, it wasn’t clear,but it was enough to make me smile every time you showed up.
29 April — When You Became My Girl
I followed you from my real account.You replied to my Pedri story —“Even I know Pedri 😭😭😭”
And that was it.That day, we really began.
Reels turned into conversations,conversations turned into comfort,and comfort turned into something I never wanted to let go of.
The Spark That Followed
I didn’t fall for you all at once.I fell slowly  in pieces, in moments, in feelings.And even now, I’m still falling.For your vibe, your warmth, the way you make things feel right.You’re my girl.
Not just someone I love but someone I choose, every day, a little more than before.">

          <p>How we met and the spark that followed ✨.</p>

        <div class="tl-item" role="button" tabindex="0" data-content="30 June 2025 — A Random Late-Night Chat
It was just a random conversation, nothing planned…
but I remember looking at the clock and realizing it was past midnight.
We talked about small things, random things, silly things…
yet somehow, it felt special.
There was a comfort in talking to you, a warmth I hadn’t expected.
Out of context hai ye chizz but I flirted with you on the first call like rizzzzz😭 you said Jaise me kisi ko call krti to voice note bhejti Mene bola tha  to kya ab mujhe bhi voice notes ayenge? 😭😭😭 fhir we were laughing">
          <span>📞</span>
          <p>Our first long talk that lasted past midnight 🌙.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tl-item" role="button" tabindex="0" data-content="That first flight together… it wasn’t just a trip.
It was hours of listening, learning, and just being close.We talked about everything and nothing dreams, silly thoughts, random stories…
and in between, there were moments of quiet understanding, where words weren’t needed.
We laughed at each other, teased a little, and slowly the day turned into a memory I didn’t want to end.There were hugs that felt natural, warm, safe…
moments that reminded me, this is my girl, and I don’t want to let go.
Every glance, every laugh, every little touch that day made me fall even more for her.That flight wasn’t just about reaching a destination it was about us discovering us,about feeling comfortable, close, and completely at ease with each other.">
          <span>🤝</span>
          <p>Our first fight—and how we listened, learned, and hugged it out 🤍.</p>

        <div class="tl-item" role="button" tabindex="0" data-content="I’ve said it to you a lot of times  sometimes indirectly, sometimes directly,
sometimes in a joke, sometimes in a quiet moment…
but every time, it came straight from my heart.
And then, on 11 June 2025, 1:40 AM, you said it to me.
That moment… everything changed.
Hearing you say “I love you” made every little thing before it feel even more real.
It was soft, it was simple, it was perfect and suddenly, the world felt like it belonged to just the two of us.Since then, every “I love you” has been our little promise,our shared heartbeat,
and a reminder that I’ve fallen for you and I keep falling even more every day.">

          <p>The first time we said “I love you.” 💖</p>

        <div class="tl-item" role="button" tabindex="0" data-content="Where We Are Now
Today, we’re growing, laughing, and loving more with every passing day.
Every moment with you the small jokes, the deep talks, the quiet comfort 
makes me fall for you even more than yesterday.
We’ve shared so much already,
and yet, every day brings something new to discover about each other.
You’re not just my girlfriend you’re my best friend, my safe place, my happiness.Every laugh, every hug, every little “I love you” reminds me
that this journey with you is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever known.
And I can’t wait for all the days, memories, and love that are still waiting for us.Because you and me,Maahi  we’re just getting started">
